# Environment Setup Guide for Installing GCC C Compiler

## Introduction

The GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is a widely used open-source compiler system that supports various programming languages, including C. This guide will help you set up GCC on different operating systems.

## Installation Instructions

### Mac

#### Step 1: Check if GCC is Already Installed

Before installing GCC, check if it is already installed on your system. Open the Terminal and run:

```bash
gcc -v
```

If GCC is installed, you will see version information. If not, proceed with the installation steps below.

#### Step 2: Install Homebrew

If you don't have Homebrew installed, you need to install it first. Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that simplifies the installation of software. Open the Terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

#### Step 3: Install GCC using Homebrew

Once Homebrew is installed, you can install GCC by running:

```bash
brew install gcc
```

For more details, refer to the [official GCC installation guide](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/).

### Linux

#### Step 1: Check if GCC is Already Installed

Open a terminal and check if GCC is installed by running:

```bash
gcc -v
```

If GCC is installed, you will see version information. If not, follow the installation steps for your specific Linux distribution below.

#### Step 2: Install GCC

**For Debian-based distributions (e.g., Ubuntu):**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc
```

### Windows

#### Step 1: Download MinGW-w64

MinGW-w64 is a port of GCC for Windows. Download the installer from the [MinGW-w64 project page](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/).

#### Step 2: Install MinGW-w64

Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation instructions. During the installation process, you can choose the architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) and the version of GCC.

#### Step 3: Add GCC to the System Path

After installation, add the MinGW-w64 binary directory to your system PATH environment variable. This allows you to use GCC from the command line.

1. Open the Start Menu, search for "Environment Variables", and select "Edit the system environment variables".
2. In the System Properties window, click on "Environment Variables".
3. In the Environment Variables window, find the "Path" variable in the "System variables" section and click "Edit".
4. Click "New" and add the path to the MinGW-w64 `bin` directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\mingw-w64\...\bin`).
5. Click "OK" to close all windows.

For more details, refer to the [official MinGW-w64 installation guide](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/).

## Verifying Installation

After installing GCC, verify the installation by opening a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) and running:

```bash
gcc -v
```
