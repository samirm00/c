# C Keywords

Keywords are predefined words in the C programming language that hold special meaning within the compiler.
These keywords cannot be utilized for any other purpose such as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers.
According to the C99 standard, the C language includes 32 keywords. Keywords are exclusively lowercase, and C is case-sensitive,
meaning that `int` is a recognized keyword, but `INT` or `Int` are not.

## Characteristics of C Keywords

1. **Reserved Usage**: Keywords are reserved and cannot be used as identifiers.
2. **Case Sensitivity**: All keywords are in lowercase and C distinguishes between uppercase and lowercase letters.
3. **Syntax Enforcement**: The compiler strictly enforces the use of these keywords for their intended purpose.
4. **Keyword Introduction**: Some keywords introduced from the C99 standard onwards may begin with an underscore.

## List of Reserved Keywords in C

Below is a comprehensive table of all the reserved keywords in the C programming language, including those that start with an underscore introduced in C99 and later standards:
