# Token

In the context of the C programming language, a token is the smallest unit of the source code. The concept of a token is borrowed from linguistics, where a piece of text is made up of words, digits, and punctuation marks. Similarly, a C program is broken down into tokens by the compiler during the compilation process.

## Compilation Process

### Tokenizer

The first stage in the compilation process is the tokenizer. This component divides the source code into individual tokens, identifies their types, and passes them one at a time to the next stage of the compiler.

### Parser

The parser is the next stage. It understands the grammar of the language, identifies syntax errors, and translates an error-free program into machine code.

## Types of Tokens in C

A C source code consists of various types of tokens:

- Character set
- Keywords
- Literals
- Identifiers
- Operators
- Special symbols

### Character Set

The C language character set includes:

- Uppercase letters: A to Z
- Lowercase letters: a to z
- Digits: 0 to 9
- Special characters: ! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + - . : , ; ` ~ = < > { } [ ] ^ _ / \

Some character combinations have special meanings, known as escape sequences (e.g., `\n` for newline).

### Keywords

Keywords in C are predefined sequences of alphabets that have special meanings. C originally had 32 keywords, and more have been added in later versions. All keywords are in lowercase and must be used according to specific syntax rules.

### Literals

Literals are representations of values directly hard-coded in the source code. Types of literals include:

- Numeric literals: Contain digits, a decimal point, and/or an exponentiation character (E or e).
- String literals: Sequences of characters enclosed in double quotes.
- Character literals: Single characters enclosed in single quotes.
- Array literals: Comma-separated sequences of literals enclosed in square brackets.
- Escape sequences: Two or more characters, starting with a backslash (`\`), with predefined meanings.

### Identifiers

Identifiers are user-defined names for various elements in a program, such as variables, constants, labels, types, and functions. Identifiers must follow specific rules, including not using reserved keywords (e.g., `for` cannot be an identifier).

### Operators

Operators are symbols used to perform arithmetic and comparison operations. Common operators include:

- Arithmetic: +, -, *, /
- Comparison: <, >

### Special Symbols

Special symbols in C include punctuation marks and other characters used in different contexts, such as:

- Commas, semicolons, and colons
- Parentheses for arithmetic expressions and function definitions
- Curly brackets to mark the scope of functions and code blocks
