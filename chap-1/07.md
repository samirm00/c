# Identifiers in C

Identifiers in C play a crucial role in identifying variables, constants, functions, and other elements within a program. As a high-level programming language,
C allows developers to reference memory locations by meaningful names instead of binary or hexadecimal addresses. This not only makes the code more readable
but also more manageable.

Identifiers are user-defined names that help in referring to memory locations conveniently. They are used to define various elements in a program,
such as functions, user-defined types, labels, and more. When an identifier is used to define a variable or a function, the C compiler allocates memory
for it and associates the identifier with this memory location. Consequently, whenever the identifier is referenced in the code,
the compiler accesses the corresponding memory location.

## Naming Rules for C Identifiers

To ensure that identifiers are valid and follow the conventions of the C language, several naming rules must be observed:

1. **Keywords**: Keywords, which are predefined reserved words in C, cannot be used as identifiers.
2. **Character Set**: Identifiers can only consist of alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and the underscore (`_`) symbol.
   Characters such as punctuation marks and other symbols are not allowed.
3. **First Character**: The identifier must begin with either an alphabet (uppercase or lowercase) or an underscore. It cannot start with a digit.
4. **Subsequent Characters**: Following the first character, the identifier may include alphabets, digits, or underscores.
5. **Uniqueness**: An identifier must be unique within its scope. The same identifier cannot be used for more than one entity within the same scope.

## Scope of Identifiers

The scope of an identifier in C refers to the region of the code where the identifier can be accessed. There are two primary types of scopes in C:

1. **Global (External) Scope**: An identifier declared outside of all functions is considered to have a global scope. It is accessible from any function within the program.
2. **Local (Internal) Scope**: An identifier declared within a function is considered to have a local scope. It is only accessible within the function where it is declared.

## Example

Below is an example demonstrating the use of identifiers in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Global identifier
int globalVariable = 10;

void my_func() {
  // Local identifier
  int localVariable = 20;
  printf("Local Variable: %d\n", localVariable);
}

int main() {
  my_func();
  printf("Global Variable: %d\n", globalVariable);
  return 0;
}
```

In this example, `globalVariable` is a global identifier, accessible from both the `main` function and `my_func()`. Conversely,
`localVariable` is a local identifier, only accessible within `my_func()`.
